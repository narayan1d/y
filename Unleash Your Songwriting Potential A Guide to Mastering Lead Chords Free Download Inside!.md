## What Exactly Are Lead Chords?

The term "lead chord" isn't a strictly defined music theory term, but it refers to chords used strategically within a progression to create a specific effect. They often function as:

*   **Passing Chords:** These chords bridge the gap between two diatonic chords (chords naturally occurring in the key), creating a smoother and more interesting transition.
*   **Borrowed Chords:** These chords are "borrowed" from parallel keys (major or minor) to add a touch of harmonic color and surprise.
*   **Secondary Dominants:** These chords create a strong pull towards a target chord, intensifying the sense of resolution.
*   **Altered Chords:** These chords include altered notes (sharpened or flattened) that add dissonance and complexity.
*   **Pivot Chords:** Chords that belong to more than one key, used to modulate between different key centres.

## Why Use Lead Chords?

Lead chords offer a multitude of benefits for songwriters and musicians:

*   **Enhanced Harmonic Interest:** They break the monotony of predictable chord progressions, keeping the listener engaged.
*   **Emotional Depth:** Lead chords can evoke a wide range of emotions, from tension and excitement to resolution and peace.
*   **Unique Sound:** They allow you to create a distinctive and memorable sound that sets your music apart.
*   **Improved Song Structure:** They can help you create stronger sections within your songs, such as verses, choruses, and bridges.
*   **Greater Expressiveness:** They enable you to express yourself more fully through your music.

## Common Types of Lead Chords and How to Use Them

Let's explore some of the most common and effective lead chords, along with examples of how to incorporate them into your songs.

### 1. Secondary Dominants

Secondary dominants are dominant chords (chords built a perfect fifth above a root note that has a major 3rd and minor 7th interval) that resolve to a chord other than the tonic (the root chord of the key). They create a strong pull towards the target chord, making it sound more important and impactful.

**Example:** In the key of C major, the dominant chord is G7. However, the V/V (five of five) secondary dominant chord would be D7. This chord creates a strong pull towards the V (G) chord, which then resolves to the I (C) chord. A common progression would then be C - D7 - G - C.

**How to use it:** Identify the chord you want to emphasize (e.g., the V chord). Find the dominant chord of that chord (the chord built a perfect fifth above it). Insert that secondary dominant chord *before* the target chord.

### 2. Borrowed Chords

Borrowed chords, also known as modal interchange chords, are chords taken from parallel keys (major or minor) or other modes. They add a touch of unexpected color and can create a sense of nostalgia, sadness, or longing.

**Example:** In C major, borrowing the minor iv chord (fm) from C minor can add a melancholic feel. A progression like C - G - Am - F - Fm - C can be very effective.

**How to use it:** Experiment with borrowing chords from the parallel minor key or other modes. Common borrowed chords include minor iv, bVII, and bIII. Listen to how these chords sound in context and adjust them to fit your song.

### 3. Passing Chords

Passing chords smoothly connect two diatonic chords. They often use chromatic movement (movement by half steps) to create a sense of flow and avoid jarring transitions.

**Example:** Moving from C to Dm in C major can be made smoother by using a C#dim chord (C - C#dim - Dm). The chromatic movement from C to C# creates a pleasing, ear-catching transition.

**How to use it:** Look for opportunities to connect two chords with a passing chord that moves chromatically. Diminished chords are often used as passing chords due to their inherent instability and tendency to resolve.

### 4. Altered Chords

Altered chords contain notes that have been sharpened or flattened, creating a more dissonant and complex sound. They add tension and can be used to create a dramatic effect.

**Example:** A C7#9 (C dominant 7 sharp 9) chord is an altered chord frequently used in blues and jazz. It creates a very tense and distinctive sound.

**How to use it:** Use altered chords sparingly to create moments of intense emotion or drama. Experiment with different alterations to find the sounds you like.

### 5. Pivot Chords

Pivot chords share notes and functions between two different keys or modes, allowing for seamless modulation. Using a pivot chord lets you change from one key to another without abrupt jumps.

**Example:** The chord Am (A minor) is found in both the key of C major (vi chord) and the key of A minor (i chord). It could be used as a pivot to modulate between C major and A minor.

**How to use it:** Identify chords common to the original key and the target key. Use this shared chord as a bridge, smoothly transitioning into the new key. This gives your song a natural shift in tone.

## Putting it All Together: Examples in Songwriting

Let's look at some examples of how lead chords can be used in real-world songwriting scenarios.

**Example 1: Adding Color to a Verse**

*   Original progression: C - G - Am - F
*   With lead chords: C - G - Am - Em7b5 - F

Here, the Em7b5 acts as a passing diminished chord between Am and F, adding a touch of sophistication and melancholy.

**Example 2: Creating a More Dramatic Chorus**

*   Original progression: G - C - G - D
*   With lead chords: G - C - G - A7 - D

The A7 functions as a secondary dominant (V/V) leading strongly into the D chord, which creates a more powerful and impactful resolution.

**Example 3: Adding a Touch of Blues**

*   Original progression: E - A - B7 - E
*   With lead chords: E - E7 - A - B7 - E

The addition of E7 (a dominant 7th chord built on the tonic) adds a bluesy feel to the progression.

## Beyond the Basics: Experimentation is Key

While understanding the theory behind lead chords is helpful, the most important thing is to experiment and find what sounds good to *you*. Don't be afraid to try different combinations and break the rules. The best lead chords are often the ones you discover through experimentation.
