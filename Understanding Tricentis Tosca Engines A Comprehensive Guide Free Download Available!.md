## What are Tricentis Tosca Engines?

Think of Tosca engines as translators. They bridge the gap between Tosca's test cases and the underlying technology of the application you're testing. Each engine is specifically designed to understand and interact with a particular technology, such as web applications, desktop applications, APIs, databases, and more. Without these engines, Tosca wouldn't be able to "talk" to the application and execute the test steps defined in your test cases.

In essence, engines are the drivers that enable Tosca to:

*   **Identify and locate UI elements:** Engines allow Tosca to recognize and interact with buttons, text fields, dropdowns, and other UI elements within the application.
*   **Perform actions:** Engines facilitate the execution of actions like clicking buttons, entering text, selecting options, and verifying data.
*   **Retrieve data:** Engines enable Tosca to extract data from the application for validation and comparison against expected results.
*   **Communicate with different technologies:** Each engine is designed to handle the specific protocols and communication methods of its target technology.

## Types of Tricentis Tosca Engines
