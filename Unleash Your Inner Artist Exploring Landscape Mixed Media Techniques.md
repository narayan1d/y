## What is Landscape Mixed Media?

Landscape mixed media is, at its core, the art of combining different materials and techniques to create a single landscape artwork. Unlike traditional painting methods that rely primarily on paint, mixed media opens the door to a vast array of possibilities. Think of it as expanding your artistic vocabulary to include not only brushes and paints, but also papers, fabrics, fibers, found objects, and more.

The beauty of mixed media lies in its versatility. It allows you to create unique textures, add layers of visual interest, and express your artistic vision in ways that are simply not possible with traditional methods. You can incorporate collage elements, create three-dimensional effects, and experiment with a wide range of textures, from smooth and glossy to rough and rugged.
