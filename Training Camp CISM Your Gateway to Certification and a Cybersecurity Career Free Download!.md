While a "training camp" might conjure images of arduous physical challenges, a CISM training camp is an intensive educational experience. It's a concentrated period of study, typically lasting several days, where participants engage in lectures, discussions, practice questions, and simulated scenarios designed to comprehensively cover the four domains of the CISM exam.
