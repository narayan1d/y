## What is a Grief Educator?

A grief educator is a trained professional who provides education, support, and resources to individuals, families, and communities dealing with grief and loss. They help people understand the grieving process, develop coping mechanisms, and navigate the emotional, psychological, and spiritual challenges associated with loss. Unlike grief counselors or therapists, grief educators primarily focus on providing information and facilitating support groups rather than providing individual therapy. Their role is often preventative, helping people build resilience and coping skills before or during the grieving process.
