## What is Property and Casualty Insurance?

Property and casualty insurance is a broad category that encompasses two primary types of coverage:

*   **Property Insurance:** This type of insurance protects your physical assets, such as your home, car, or business premises, from damage or loss due to events like fire, theft, vandalism, storms, and other perils.
*   **Casualty (Liability) Insurance:** This type of insurance protects you from financial losses if you are found legally liable for causing bodily injury or property damage to someone else. This can include accidents, negligence, or even certain contractual obligations.

Unlike life insurance, which pays out upon death, P&C insurance protects against specific, often unpredictable, events that can cause financial harm.

## Key Types of Casualty (Liability) Insurance

Casualty insurance provides financial protection when you are held responsible for causing harm to others. Common types include:
